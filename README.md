## Assignment 1
Assignment 1 deal with a random deposition process. We cover a surface one atom at a time, with adsorption on each site random and independent on previous adsorptions. What is the distribution of atoms on the surface? How long does it take for the whole surface to be covered by at least one atom per site?
## Assignment 2
The second assignment is related to optimal selection. What is the distribution of the highest value in a random population? How does the variance of this distribiution change as the random population grows?
## Assignment 3
This assignment is about the uniform distribution, its moments, the use of the characteristic function, and the central limit theorem.
